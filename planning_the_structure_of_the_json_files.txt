we have 2 files of type .json

1. auto_complete_data.json
    this file hold all substring of the sentence in system
    for every key, we hold 5 result

    what is result?
    result is sentence that the key is substring of it.

    result describe by sentence_id, score, offset

2. sentence.json
    this file hold all sentence and their file path
    the key is id_sentence
    for every key, we hold sentence and path



how it work?

when the user type substring, the system search it in keys from auto_complete_data.json
and return 3 lists: sentence_id, score, offset

now we extract the sentences:
for every sentence_id the system search it in keys from sentence.json
and return the sentence and path
